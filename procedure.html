    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>In this week's project, the challenge was to apply physics, engineering, and human-centered design to come up with a machine that does work, entirely powered by human effort. The machine was built using readily available materials that are environmentally friendly. It was a blend of physics, creativity, and problem-solving. 
    The group came up with a system for fetching water. It is a single fixed pulley that demonstrates mechanical advantage and explains how pulley systems work. The task involved was pulling where a user pulls

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>Cut the carton to create the roof of the well, and the bottom part was to hold the jug containing water.
<br><br>
Placed a stick on both sides of the carton to create stands.
<br><br>
Placed a bamboo stick crossing from one stand to the other horizontally.
<br><br>
Used nails to make holes in the can where the rope went through.
<br><br>
Hang the can on the bamboo stick with a string
<br><br>
Made wheels out of the carton to lower and lift the can to fetch water from the jug.
<br><br>
Designed the wall part of the well on plain paper and used glue to attach it to the walls of the carton.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>The machine is a well. A user uses the wheel to lower the can into the jug and fetch water. The user moves the wheel in a clockwise direction to pull the water and transfer it to a bucket or a drum.</p>
    <p>The mechanical principle involved is work, where the user transfers energy to an object by applying force along the pulley. With a constant force aligned with the direction of motion, the work is equal to the product of the force strength and the distance travelled. The mechanical advantage of this system is 1 because the force input is equal to the output force, which is determined by the amount of water fetched.</p>
    <p>The system is energy efficient because it is easier than pulling water directly from the well with only a rope and no pulley. Its design ensures the user's safety, as it has walls that prevent the user from tripping and falling in case of an accident.
    The system worked as expected. An improvement would be to increase the speed at which the pulley lowers the can to fetch water. This will remove the need to lower it manually, and a downward force would pull the tin towards the water. The only work done would be pulling the water.</p>
