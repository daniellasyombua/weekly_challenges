    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this week's project, the challenge was to apply physics, engineering, and human-centered design to come up with a machine that does work, 
      entirely powered by human effort. The machine was built using readily available materials that are environmentally friendly. It was a blend of
       physics, creativity, and problem-solving. 
The group came up with a system for fetching water. It is a single fixed pulley that demonstrates mechanical advantage and explains how pulley systems
 work. The task involved was pulling where a user pulls water from the well.

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ul class="procedure-list">
      <li>Cut the carton to create the roof of the well, and the bottom part was to hold the jug containing water.</li>
      <li>Place bamboo sticks on both sides of the carton to create stands.</li>
      <li>Position a bamboo stick horizontally across the stands to act as the pulley support.</li>
      <li>Use nails to create holes in the can for the rope to pass through.</li>
      <li>Hang the can on the horizontal bamboo stick using a string.</li>
      <li>Craft wheels from the carton to facilitate lowering and lifting the can for water fetching.</li>
      <li>Design the well’s walls on plain paper and attach them to the carton using glue.</li>
    </ul>

 <section class="how-it-works section">
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <div class="video-text">
        <div class="text-section">
    <p>The machine functions as a well, where a user operates the wheel to lower a can into the jug to fetch water. By
      rotating the wheel clockwise, the user pulls the water up to transfer it into a bucket or drum.</p>
    <p>The mechanical principle is based on work, where energy is transferred by applying force along the pulley. The
      mechanical advantage is 1, as the input force equals the output force, determined by the water’s weight. This
      system is energy-efficient compared to pulling water directly with a rope, and its walled design enhances user
      safety by preventing accidents.</p>
    <p>The system performs as expected, but an improvement could involve increasing the pulley’s speed to lower the can
      automatically, reducing manual effort to only pulling the water upward.</p>
